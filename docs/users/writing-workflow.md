# Writing Workflow

## Core Editor Behavior

- TON3S opens directly into the editor.
- Notes auto-save while you type.
- Content is persisted in IndexedDB inside your browser profile.

## Notes and Navigation

- Create notes from the sidebar.
- Use search to filter by title, text, or tags.
- Select a note to load it into the editor.

## Workspace Controls

- `Cmd/Ctrl + N`: new note
- `Cmd/Ctrl + K` or `Cmd/Ctrl + F`: focus search
- `Cmd/Ctrl + T`: rotate theme
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + U`: open media upload picker
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + ?`: show keyboard shortcuts
- `Escape`: close panels and exit zen mode

## Zen Mode

- While typing, TON3S can enter zen mode automatically.
- Move your mouse or press `Escape` to exit zen mode.

## Mobile Navigation

On mobile, TON3S switches between page views for editor, notes, Nostr, and donations.

## Practical Writing Loop

1. Draft in the editor.
2. Tag the note for later search.
3. Export markdown for publishing or archival.
4. Export all notes as JSON for full backup.

## Next Step

Continue to [Import, Export, and Backups](import-export.md).
