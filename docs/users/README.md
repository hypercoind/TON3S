## Key Facts (Plain Language)

- Your notes are stored in your browser profile on your device.
- You can keep using TON3S offline after the app has loaded.
- You do not need Nostr unless you want to publish.
- Nostr traffic goes through the backend proxy to hide your IP from relays.
- Media uploads larger than 10 MB go directly to your chosen Blossom server.
